# Quartz.NET-RavenJobStore
Not exactly a fork of, but inspired by [Quartz.NET-RavenDB](https://github.com/ravendb/quartznet-RavenDB)

Under development, no release yet.

## Project goals
* Can handle high volumes of jobs and triggers.
* Suitable for clustered schedulers.
* Different schedulers (instance names) can share the same database.
